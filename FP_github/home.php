      <h2>Why We Donate Blood?</h2>
      <p>
        As of 2023, blood is still universally recognized as a precious resource for saving lives. The demand for blood remains high, with approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells needed daily. Each year, over 29 million units of blood components are transfused worldwide. Despite the increase in donors, blood shortages during emergencies persist, primarily due to limited accessibility and awareness. In some regions, blood shortages have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected donor turnout. Therefore, it is crucial to continue promoting blood donation and increasing accessibility to ensure that blood remains available for those who need it.
